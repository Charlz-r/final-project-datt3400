## ðŸ›° Overview  
The **Space Fight Simulator** is an interactive 3D experience where players pilot a spaceship using **head-tracking controls**. Instead of traditional inputs, the game leverages **ML5.js FaceMesh** to detect facial movements, allowing players to steer and boost their ship naturally.  

The simulation features:  
- **AI-Powered Face Tracking** â€“ Move your head to control the ship.  
- **Dynamic Asteroid Field** â€“ Navigate through floating space debris.  
- **Multiple Camera Modes** â€“ Switch between third-person and orbital views.  
- **Web-Based & 3D Rendered** â€“ Runs in the browser using **WebGL & Processing.js**.

## ðŸŽ® Features  

### ðŸŒŒ **Head-Tracked Flight Controls**  
- **Tilt Left/Right** â€“ Steer the spaceship.  
- **Look Up/Down** â€“ Adjust pitch.  
- **Boost** â€“ Press `Spacebar` for a speed burst.  

### ðŸŽ¥ **Camera Modes**  
- **Third-Person View (`1`)** â€“ Follow the spaceship from behind.  
- **Orbital View (`2`)** â€“ Rotate around the scene for a wider perspective.  

### ðŸ–¥ **Technical Overview**  

#### **Object-Oriented Codebase**  
The simulator is built using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles, with structured classes for:  
- **Spaceship** â€“ Handles movement, boosting, and physics.  
- **Asteroids (Orb Class)** â€“ Floating objects that move and bounce dynamically.  
- **Camera (Cam Class)** â€“ Manages position, transitions, and smooth tracking.  

#### **3D WebGL Rendering**  
- **Built with Processing.js** â€“ A WebGL-based environment for real-time 3D visuals.  
- **Asteroid Physics** â€“ Objects move with randomized velocity and rotation.  
- **Smooth Camera Movement** â€“ Uses **linear interpolation (lerp)** for transitions.  

### ðŸŽ¯ **AI-Powered Face Tracking**  
Powered by **ML5.js FaceMesh**, the game tracks facial landmarks in real time:  
- **Turn Left/Right** â€“ Tilt your head to steer.  
- **Look Up/Down** â€“ Adjust vertical movement.  
- **Boost** â€“ Activate speed with the `Spacebar`.  

ðŸ’¡ *Face tracking detects head orientation and calculates movement for an intuitive experience.*

## ðŸ•¹ How to Play  

### **Basic Controls**  
| Action | Face Tracking | Keyboard |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Turn Left/Right | Tilt Head Sideways | N/A |
| Look Up/Down | Move Head Up/Down | N/A |
| Boost | N/A | `Spacebar` |
| Camera Mode 1 (Third-Person) | N/A | `1` |
| Camera Mode 2 (Orbital View) | N/A | `2` |

### **Gameplay Flow**  
1. **Start the Simulation** â€“ The spaceship and asteroids load into the 3D world.  
2. **Navigate** â€“ Move your head to steer the spaceship.  
3. **Boost When Needed** â€“ Use `Spacebar` for a quick burst of speed.  
4. **Switch Camera Views** â€“ Press `1` or `2` to change perspectives.  
5. **Explore & Experiment** â€“ Interact with asteroids and adjust your viewpoint.
